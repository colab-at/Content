<h2>Colab is a collaborative effort to bring people <strong>together </strong>around great ideas.</h2>
We believe that by upgrading collaboration with tools for open information, enabling distributed ownership, and making resources available to everyone, we will be able to have more people thriving on the diversity of different ideas and building greater ideas on top of those.

If we raise collaboration beyond its present boundaries, we will be able to bring a more fair distribution of opportunities to everyone, and as a result create the willingness for people to participate and contribute at a larger scale and to have a positive impact on the world.

Think of every time you wanted to start something but didn’t know where to start, or felt that there just weren’t enough people around that shared the same passion. Imagine if there was a place where you could share your ideas, get help in making them happen and at the same time contribute to the ideas of others. Imagine the difference it would make if you could contribute to the ideas that mattered the most to you and make them your own.

That’s what we are building here. Join us!
